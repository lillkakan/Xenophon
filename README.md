## Feutures

The keyboard feutures an ortholinear design.
70 buttons
The keyboard feutures 70 buttons to simuate a standard 60% keyboard as much as possible.

trs jack connection
The pcb is designed with a trs jack nicley placed between the tilted keys.
The two processors sent data through the serial bitbang protocol.

smart flashing design
Because i diden't want to include a usb port on the right pcb i added two usb pins (D+ and D-) on both sides so that i could solder all the componens except the left processors and flash the right side easily.

usb c
The PCB feutures a usb type c port with capability to connect via a usb-c to usb-c cable or a standard usb-c to usb-a cable.

button less
Because small reset buttons take up unneccesary space on the pcb i added pins for for both sides reset connection designed so that a regular cable could pull the reset down.

3D printable chassi.
The chassi for the keyboard is 3D printable and is designed to be as small as possible while still protecting the pcb and the electrical components.
